# relearning

The tutorial associated with this repo can be found here: https://happygitwithr.com/

While I attended a few workshops on GitHub while in grad school, I did not fullly utilize it for my dissertation thesis. 

This repo is to relearn Git and GitHub as I will be using it quite a lot for my postdoc research.
